I am a first year master student in [Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering](https://www.ese.upenn.edu) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu) with a concentration on Machine Learning and Data Science. I received my dual B.Sc. in Data Science from [Duke Kunshan University](https://www.dukekunshan.edu.cn) and [Duke University](https://www.duke.edu), where I worked closely with [Peng Sun](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/Peng.Sun1) and [Enmao Diao](https://diaoenmao.com/). 

My research interest primarily revolves around enhancing **efficiency** and promoting **trustworthiness** in existing generative models. I am also interested in exploring the theory and application of learning quantized representations. My long-term objective is to develop intelligent systems that are both effective and reliable. 

<span style="color: blue;">I am currently seeking for a Ph.D. position related to Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing in 2025 Fall.</span>
